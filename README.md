# Commerce Services - Technical Interview

### Context

We are an online book store. We have an API that returns our catalog and stock. 
We want to implement two new features in our system:
- Process new orders
- Retrieve existing orders

### Functional Requirements

- **Create a new Order**:
  - The application receives orders in a JSON format through an HTTP API endpoint (POST).
  - Orders contain a list of books and the quantity.
  - Before registering the order, the system should check if there's enough stock to fulfill the order (`src/main/resources/import.sql` will set the initial stock).
  - If one of the books in the order does not have enough stock we will reject the entire order.
  - After stock validation, the order is marked as a success, and it would return a Unique Order Identifier to the caller of the HTTP API endpoint.
  - If the order was processed we need to update available stock, taking into consideration:
    - Updating stock should not be a blocker for replying to the customer.
    - If the process of updating stock fails, should not cause an error in order processing.

- **Retrieve Orders**:
  - The application has an endpoint to extract a list of existing orders. So that we can run `curl localhost:8080/orders/` and get a list of them

### Required

- Resolution needs to be fully in English
- You need to use Java 17
- This repo contains the existing bookstore code; fork or create a public repository with your solution.
- We expect you to implement tests for the requested functionalities. You decide the scope.
- **Once the code is complete, reply to your hiring person of contact.**

### How to run

Building
```shell
$ ./mvnw compile
```

Test
```shell
$ ./mvnw test
```

Start the application

```shell
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
